# 411

A .411 to PNG converter.

# .411?

The 411 file format is (was) a propitiatory image format created by Sony to store the thumbnails of images taken on some of their early-2000s cameras.
It's a relatively simple format, which is good, given its only official application is creating 64x48 images that are seen scrolling through a menu.

# Why?

I found that for whatever reason I have a program called `411toppm` installed. After reading the man page I thought it'd be interesting to take a crack
at it myself.

The source for the original C implementation can be found here: https://fossies.org/linux/netpbm/converter/ppm/411toppm.c.
While this may not strictly be a "derived version" of the original implementation, I place, as requested, this notice:
